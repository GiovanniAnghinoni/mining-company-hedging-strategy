# Mining Company Hedging Strategy
This repository provides a series of coding scripts used to develop a model which can be used by a cryptocurrency mining company in order to hedge itself against rising energy prices. In particular, this strategy could be implemented by a mining firm that produces its own energy. One important feature of this model is the fact that it can be applied to a wide range of different energy sources, given the fact that it uses a versatile tool such as the Raspberry Pi.
